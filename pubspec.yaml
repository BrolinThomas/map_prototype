  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
  

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: SF PRO DISPLAY
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/font/SFPRODISPLAYREGULAR.OTF
        - asset: assets/font/SFPRODISPLAYMEDIUM.OTF
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/font/SFPRODISPLAYBOLD.OTF
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/font/SFPRODISPLAYLIGHTITALIC.OTF
          weight: 300
          style: italic
        - asset: assets/font/SFPRODISPLAYTHINITALIC.OTF
          weight: 100
          style: italic
        - asset: assets/font/SFPRODISPLAYULTRALIGHTITALIC.OTF
          weight: 200
          style: italic
        - asset: assets/font/SFPRODISPLAYSEMIBOLDITALIC.OTF
          weight: 600
          style: italic
        - asset: assets/font/SFPRODISPLAYHEAVYITALIC.OTF
          weight: 800
          style: italic
        - asset: assets/font/SFPRODISPLAYBLACKITALIC.OTF
